8-Operation ALU in VHDL for Basys 3 FPGA (class project)

 SuperFancyALU â€“ VHDL ALU Design

This project was developed as part of Digital Design Lab at Penn State Behrend.

It implements an 8-operation Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) on the Basys 3 FPGA board using VHDL, with shared output to a 7-segment display. Operations include add, AND, OR, XOR, compare (G/E/L), and checks for odd, even, and prime.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- VHDL
- Xilinx Vivado 2017.2
- Basys 3 FPGA (Artix-7)
- Custom 7-segment display decoder

## ðŸ‘¥ Notes
This was a team-based class project. The code reflects collaborative work and is posted here to showcase my contributions and experience with VHDL and FPGA design.
